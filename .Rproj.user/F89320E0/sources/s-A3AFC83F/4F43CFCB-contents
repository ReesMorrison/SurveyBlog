Latent Semantic Scaling:  LSS estimates semantic similarity of words based on their surrounding contexts, so a LSS model should be trained on data where the text unit is sentence. It is also affected by noises in data such as function words and punctuation marks, so they should also be removed. It requires larger corpus of texts (5000 or moreserve documents) to accurately estimate semantic proximity. The sample corpus contains 10,000 Guardian news articles from 2016.  devtools::install_github("koheiw/LSX")  Write author

New idea:  Feb. 12, 2022 Combine all of the subtheme paragraphs. Do text similarities among subthemes with Reinert. Determine which themes have the most subtheme connections as an indicator of complexity. Create a social network graph.  ALTERNATIVELY treat the Theme as classification and see if a model can predict which subthemes belong to that class, i.e., from a training set of random 10 subthemes, pick out the others and test for precision, recall and the hypergeometric mean of those two.

This paper compares Hugo and Nebula award-winning short stories using text mining and logistic regression. Science fiction is known for its radical singularity: each text is an ‘event’ in the philosophical sense, creating a universe unto itself. In this light, unlike traditional criticism, quantitative methods generalize in the absence of unifying conventions or topoi. Parallel to Meillassoux's concept of extro-science fiction, digital humanities acts as ‘extro-criticism’ within fields of radical contingency (‘hyperchaos’). This asemic forensics not only traces 114 stories’ lexical detritus to each award’s institutional schemata, but presages xenographic re-mappings for conventional literary notions of ‘code’, ‘genre’, and ‘text’.

Fix dollar signs of Books after I figure out whether they need to be escaped.  Seems to render to PDF with either \$ or no escape!
Learn keyboard shortcuts like remove word right Ctrl+Del or left Ctrl+Backspace; select to end of document is Ctrl+Shift+End
Make consistent the style of Expressions (lower case, no quotes) and Records (* 2 hyphens or dash?, URL cites in PDF footnote). Alphabatize Expressions; finish searches by Sharmilaa?
Print book on Anne's printer (2-ply), edit, and have Fran Gieda make changes in NotePad?

Use PNG for R graphics output, and high-resolution if you plan to print. Don't ever use JPG for R graphics output.  From https://blog.revolutionanalytics.com/2017/06/rmarkdown-tricks.html

*Italicize* titles of works (movies, paintings, books, magazines, newspapers, sculptures, plays). Use "quotation marks" for shorter works (poems, songs, articles). 

When you quote a single line of poetry, write it like any other short quotation. If the piece of poetry you are quoting crosses multiple lines of the poem itself, show the reader where the poem's line breaks fall by using slash marks.  In his poem, "Mending Wall," Robert Frost writes: "Something there is that doesn't love a wall,/ that send the frozen-ground-swell under it" (42-44).

If the quotation is three lines or longer, set it off like a block quotation (see above). Some writers prefer to set off two-line verse quotations for emphasis. Quote the poem line by line as it appears on the original page. Do not use quotation marks, and indent one inch from the left margin.

bold text, use two underscores (__text__) or double asterisks (**text**). R package names are in bold text (e.g., **rmarkdown**)

To keep the indentation in verses, use line blocks by starting the line with a vertical bar (|). The line breaks and any leading spaces will be preserved in the output. For example:  DID NOT WORK

| When dollars appear it's a sign
|   that your code does not quite align  

turn hyperlinks in text into footnotes for PDF output, because readers will not be able to click the links (generated from \href{URL}{text}).  See https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-preamble.html

inline R code, use a pair of backticks, e.g., `code`.3   But is this R package function?

Writing to PDF, LaTeX code can be used in the .Rmd file. Pandoc will respect both the LaTeX and RMarkdown formatting when converting the file to the LaTeX file.

underline <span style="text-decoration: underline">underlined text</span> BUT <u> underlined? </u> 

Small caps by HTML tag span, e.g., <span style="font-variant:small-caps;">Small Caps</span>  THEMES?

Links: [text](link), e.g., [RStudio](https://www.rstudio.com); for internal images, add ! at start 

Footnotes: inside square brackets after caret, e.g., ^[footnote.]. No space  after period or comma

When the analtyic posts Part II and III would not render, it was because I still had index.en.html.md  I changed the name and suffix .Rmd, which left the former index!


2/10/22 Divide my LeanPub book into Art, Themes and Subthemes, then a second book Centrality and Complexity Analytics that deals with metrics [put unused metrics in Appendix] and algorithms, both books with primary title of Themes from Art.  Third book might be Themes from Art: Natural Language Processing.  Cross reference each to the other.  Publicize both on blog's main page Fourth might be R and Stylometry, or how to write better with R.  Fifth, LeaRnBridge

```


1/21/22 Could my data add to stylometry and readability?  Take all Themes, add synonyms and closely related.  Analyze passage of text for percentage of words in that, if cluster and complexity have applicability, and then correlate findings to Readability tests.  What about adding median words in sentences as another measure that perhaps hasn't been used.  What about POS analysis, always comparing to the best writers of non-fiction that I have assembled -- and can add to?  See Julia Silge on this

But a better solution for me, rather than the hardcoded "see the other poems, movies etc. is to say "See [something on NavBar]" which I can update and all posts will have available.

# Creating a blog with Hugo, blogdown, Netlify

## changes to the blog site

The first thing to understand is that Hugo builds the website pages out of blocks of code. If you are using a straightforward theme like I am then the file at:

/hugo_root/themes/theme/layouts/_default/single.html

Is the file that builds the pages. This does not contain most of the HTML that will end up in the final page, rather, it contains calls to other files that contain the needed HTML. Notably, the header.html and footer.html files.

If we want to add some custom HTML into the page header then we will need to add it to the header.html or include a call to another file that does contain the HTML. We will do that latter as it will be much easier to keep everything neat if we put the Google Analytics code in its own file.

useful:  rstudioapi::navigateToFile("config.yaml") or pick any file

Under /Themes/BlogThemes found config.yaml and changed a number of features, including title, author, some page names

/BlogThemes/themes/hugo-tanka (changed in early April 2021 to hugo-texify)

https://www.r-bloggers.com/2019/01/how-i-started-a-blog-based-on-blogdown-a-walkthrough/

look in Themes by using Files in Pane 4, and find config.  One is params.toml

Will got the HTML code for Google Analytics to be inserted in Header straight from GA.
{{ template "_internal/google_analytics.html" . }}
can add to layouts/partials/foot_custom.html (or, I believe, in header)
configure googleAnalytics in config.toml

When Hugo builds the blog, the final html files and structure go into the public folder. This is the static version of the blog and the one we will deploy to our domain.

Themes/subthemesComboMajors.xlsx I gathers the URLS, removes Bitley codes, fixed Chance, Churches, and matched URLS to subthemes.


## Twitter how to's

delete a tweet and redo? to Profile, pick tweet, click on ... upper right and "Delete"

themes.md has all the above with the name of the art and no Bitly

# in art.rmd I organized them alphabetically Movies, Painting, Poem and Rock, took out the Bitly code and kept the Additionals separate.  in df so I can concatenate them into URLS.

## Subthemes, tracking and creating a table -- see subthemes.rmd for creating the online NavBar and the collection of subthemes, but on Aug 7th I could not find all the code.  CODE BELOW to extract tags did not work

```{r findTags, eval=FALSE}
# from https://www.garrickadenbuie.com/blog/find-blogdown-tags/

# subthemes <- blogdown:::collect_yaml(fields = blogdown_content_path)
# blogdown::find_tags("Time to Develop", open = TRUE)

# How to create individual posts

Start RStudio; Open BlogThemes1 project and load packages; call blogdown::serve_site() 

Click on New Post dropdown from Addins, a Shiny interface that runs this code in your console: blogdown:::new_post_addin(). https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/

  Name the post: Theme, from "work of art," a [art genre] by artist/star etc 
  Pick the category
  Tags = subthemes. subthemes, with comma after, and comma between quoted strings, including at the end.  
  Ignore archetype?? a template for Markdown content. A template means html layout. 
  With the radio button at the bottom keep Format: Markdown, the default
  Rename [ThemeCatchy word] and save the new .md.
  Draft - delete "yes" when I want to publish, after I have created all five posts and URLS

  Copy and paste in the Word file with More and with &nbsp;  and end of lyrics and start of Expressions
  
  Make changes on my laptop in the .md file  Useful site https://www.spanishdict.com/answers/152876/line-breaks-pictures-links-and-other-formatting-tricks-#Single

blogdown creates a file structure in BlogThemes1/ that includes these folders:

  content (where blog is)
  layouts (css and js)
  R [haven't used]
  resources [haven't used]
  static (media)

  Check that each post cross-refs to the other three posts in the Theme
  Check for bold of subthemes, using **...**
  Add two spaces after single-spaced lines such as poems or song lyrics, but not line before an empty line
  Check for italics or quotes for and from the art
  Insert URLs as [underlined text](URL)   NB no space
      <!-- Insert my images and pictures from the static/media subfolder using ![](/media/picture_vacations.png)  or .jpg -->
  {width=50%, height=20%} didn't work in .md files but does in .Rmd.  Note that there is no space.  Opened image in Paint and resized to 70.  So I right clicked on the image and chose "Edit" and resized.  With the Absinthe painting the original was about 650px by 850.  I reduced it to 60% and saved, but no difference when I ran the post. 
  No quotes on file path, no need for directories above BlogThemes1.  The alt text in blue helps visually impaired people.  The underline turns blue when I do correct syntax.  
  
      'Page Bundles' organize content files. you can put resource files associated with the post (such as images and data files) inside the same directory as the post itself. This means you no longer have to put them under the static/ directory. 

    Run Check Spelling… in RStudio (under Edit menu)
    Run xfun::optipng() on the directory where the post’s images are stored (including plots output by R) for lossless reduction of the size of .png images  [RWM for jpg?]
    Run W3C Link Checker on the post preview to make sure all links are valid.
    Check YAML metadata is filled out, including title, description, categories, tags, etc.
    Check images have alt text. A web accessibility evaluation tool can help.  [https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/]

  Save the .md file and check that the changes took (then commit to GitHub).  With blogdown::serve_site() you can immediately view changes with every save using LiveReload and your .html file is properly output. Changes are local.  Viewer shows what a user would see on the site. 

  Save the URL of each post on the Blog by right clicking on the title and "Copy link location"; save the long URL in this file
  Get the Bitly short form and add it after the full URL (on Bitly, click "Create" orange tab, then "Link".  Paste in long form and click "copy" to save short form; save below long form)
  
  Go back to each post and fill in the long URLs (not Bitly short form as I can't proof work)
  
  Write tweets for Twitter (often drop "impressionist"; even spaces count against 140 limit)
    
    check my site:  blogdown::check_site(), will run all check_*() functions at once. For people familiar with GitHub, Netlify, and Hugo, you may want to just check everything with blogdown::check_site().
    
### Learn about HUGO
https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/01/09/hugo/

with the yaml package you can edit hundreds of Markdown files at once, granted you check the edits carefully. 

    
### Blog color scheme colorBrewer palette Dark2https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_flexbox_justify-content_space-around   Try out your code

.customBlogTitle in index.css  h1   and header.html
navbarLink in common.css       h2   and header.html and header.html, I changed to "center"
.customPostTitle in index.css  h3
subthemes in common.css        h4

add extra line
To add an extra line of space between paragraphs, add the HTML &nbsp; code, followed by two extra spaces (e.g. &nbsp.., replacing the periods with spaces).

I used this: https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Dark2&n=3

27,158,119  dark green for Blog Title  
217,95,2    orangy-red for tabs ()
117,112,179 purplish for blog titles   
            subthemes link
            
### Blog text font size, color and css cascading style sheets
Note: If you do not specify a font size, the default size for normal text, like paragraphs, is 16px (16px=1em).

BlogTitle
Navbar
PostTitle

### Tabs at top of blog (Navbar): About, Art and Artists, Themes, Subthemes, 

about.md to modify the About tab. 

subthemes.Rmd to update and modify subthemes

art.Rmd for the artists, works of art, themes 

themes?

# Sidebar to list Themes or related blogs
https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-would-i-create-a-sidebar-with-page-specific-related-links/9037/4


### create a form
I used Formspree to make a contact form, which is an online service (managed on GitHub) that allows you to add an HTML form to your static site. No registration, just use the form and confirm your email address once. I added the following code into my contact widget: 
https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/

## Create box for icons
config.toml has in it the elements below the blog title, such as About, Art, Themes, and Subthemes.  They have weights that determine their order.

I created an Icon element to practice boxes and made it weight 5

In BlogThemes1/content I created icon.Rmd

## Pushing changes to GitHub 

Connect to GH by clicking on "Git" above Pane 3, and then the "Commit" button

Stage files listed on the left pane by checking, which is usually all of them to either add or delete [D].  Ctrl-A picks all and then click one

Fill in Comment of what has been done

[click on box under "Staged" in Git at top right], Commit to GH, 

Push to GH [still "branch is one commit ahead of main"].  "Stop"

Then click "Close"

## Netlify

NetLify [Net Liff Fy] builds and hosts the site.  I created the website ThemesforArt.com and directed NetLify to use that site and my name (not the NetLify prefix). I don't have to go to NetLify when I make changes in an .md file and push them to GitHub

## Disqus (not a single comment as of June 29th)
Add comment counts to articles - Direct your readers to where discussions are happening or just getting started.
Remove friction - Add Trusted Users and curate your Restricted Words list so readers can comment more easily.
Moderate your community - Choose a moderation profile to make sure your comments section remains a safe and civil space for your audience.
Teach readers how to comment - Provide a tutorial on the basics of commenting to establish the right tone for your community from the very beginning.

## One-time steps for GH, NetLify etc.  

Created GH repository ("BlogThemes"), joined NetLify and linked GH to it, installed blogdown package, picked the HugoTanka theme (and modified it, later switched from that blog theme)

https://alison.rbind.io/post/new-year-new-blogdown/   [Has three other posts and is excellent!]  She wrote the following before:  https://alison.rbind.io/post/2020-12-27-blogdown-checks/

    I am strongly in favour of never using .Rmd in a blogdown site because its output is an html file, not a .markdown/.md file. from  [RWM but what about inline code?] https://masalmon.eu/2020/02/29/hugo-maintenance/
 
    use .md so Hugo converts to html, but need to edit profile  https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2020-05-25-changing-you-blogdown-workflow/  also need to add archetype to YAML

# EMAIL notices emayili

https://mvaugoyeau.netlify.app/post/presentation-off-women-international-day/#sending-the-support-with-the-package-sendmailr

https://bensstats.wordpress.com/2020/07/23/robservations-2-mail-merging-email-blasting-with-r/ with emayili

A web browser uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with a web server. Similarly, an email client (like Outlook or Thunderbird) uses SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) as the communication protocol to send emails.

```{r email, eval=FALSE}
# emayili sending email with minimal dependencies. https://datawookie.github.io/emayili/
library(emayili)

# First create a message object.  Start here and delete the existing email, or it will repeat text
email <- envelope()

# Add addresses for the sender and recipient.
email <- email %>%
  from("rees@reesmorrison.com") %>%
  to("rees@reesmorrison.com", "iamwillmorrison@gmail.com")

# There are also bcc() and reply() functions for setting the Bcc and Reply-To fields.

# Add a subject.
email <- email %>% subject("Sending to Two!")

# Add a text body. You can use html() to add an HTML body.
email <- email %>% text("The latest topic covers Time.  It draws on a poem by Andrew Marvell, a movie with Bill Murray, a painting by Degas, and a song by The Byrds.  Please let me know your thoughts and observations.")

# Add an attachment.
# email <- email %>% attachment("image.jpg")  # excel file?

# Create a SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server object and send the message.
# How do I get the password and is my gmail address my user name
# More information about this service can be found at https://www.smtpbucket.com/.
# Google's server listens for secure connections on ports 465 and 587.

email

smtp <- server(host = "smtp.gmail.com",
               port = 465,  # the SSL port
               username = "rees@reesmorrison.com",
               password = "vlmaxexlnnfpjtkn")   # we set up 2FA (factor authentication with my gmail account and it generated this random password)

# If you are using SSL, the port number is usually 465 and for TLS the port is usually 587. Even so, it's very easy to get hung up on the server details… Especially, when you try both and it doesn't work. This is most common with the major webmail services (e.g, Gmail, Yahoo, etc), because they use a different protocol by default, STARTTLS. 

smtp(msg = email)  # error  Login denied
# 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at
# 535 5.7.8  https://support.google.com/mail/?p=BadCredentials i5sm17373653qkg.32 - gsmtp

# Simply printing a message displays the header information.
email

# qp_encode(c(Rees, Will))

# You can identify emails which have been sent using {emayili} by the presence of an X-Mailer header which includes both the package name and version.
# 
# To see the guts of the message as passed to the SMTP server:
#   print(email, details = TRUE)
# 
# Using STARTTLS
# 
# If you're trying to send email with a host that uses the STARTTLS security protocol (like Google Mail), then it will most probably be blocked due to insufficient security. In order to circumvent this, you can grant access to less secure apps. See the links below for specifics:
#   
#   Google (details)
# 
 
# other R packages which also send emails:
  
# blastula
# blatr (Windows)
# gmailr
# mail
# mailR
# sendmailR
# ponyexpress
```


```{r packagegmailr, eval=FALSE}
# Sending Messages With Gmailr"

library(gmailr)

## Constructing a MIME message
## Text First we will construct a simple text only message

text_msg <- gm_mime() %>%
  gm_to("rees@reesmorrison.com") %>%
  gm_from("rees@reesmorrison.com") %>%
  gm_text_body("Gmailr is a very handy package!")

# You can convert the message to a properly formatted MIME message using `as.character()`.
# Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is an Internet standard that extends the format of email messages to support text in character sets other than ASCII, as well as attachments of audio, video, images, and application programs.
# 
# ```{r sending_messages_simple_print}
# strwrap(as.character(text_msg))
# ```

### HTML

# You can also construct html messages.  It is customary to provide a text only message along with the html message, but with modern email clients this is not strictly necessary.

# html_msg <- gm_mime() %>%
#   gm_to("james.f.hester@gmail.com") %>%
#   gm_from("me@somewhere.com") %>%
#   gm_html_body("<b>Gmailr</b> is a <i>very</i> handy package!")


### Attachments

# You can add attachments to your message in two ways.
# 
# 1. If the data is in a file, use `gm_attach_file()`.  The mime type is automatically guessed by `mime::guess_type`, or you can specify it yourself with the `type` parameter.

# write.csv(file = "iris.csv", iris)
# 
# msg <- html_msg %>%
#   gm_subject("Here are some flowers") %>%
#   gm_attach_file("iris.csv")


# 2. If the data are already loaded into R, you can use `gm_attach_part()` to attach the binary data to your file.
# sending_messages_attachments_1}
# <!-- msg <- html_msg %>% -->
# <!--   gm_attach_part(part = charToRaw("attach me!"), name = "please") -->


# <!-- ### Including images -->

# <!-- You can also add use attached images in HTML by setting the Content ID feature of mime emails. This can be done by referencing the image via a `<img -->
# <!-- src=cid:xyz>` tag using the `id` argument of `send_file()`. The tag value can by any unique identifier. E.g. here is an example of including a ggplot2 image -->

# First create a plot to send, and save it to mtcars.png
# mtcars$gear <- as.factor(mtcars$gear)
# 
# png("mtcars.png", width = 400, height = 400, pointsize = 12)
# with(mtcars,
#      plot(hp,
#           mpg,
#           col = as.factor(gear),
#           pch = 19,
#           xlab = "Horsepower",
#           ylab = "Miles / gallon"
#      )
# )
# legend("topright", title = "# gears",
#        pch = 19,
#        col = seq_along(levels(mtcars$gear)),
#        legend = levels(mtcars$gear)
# )
# dev.off()

# Next create an HTML email that references the plot as 'foobar'
# email <- gm_mime() %>%
#   gm_to('someaddress@somewhere.com') %>%
#   gm_from("someaddress@somewhere.com") %>%
#   gm_subject("Cars report") %>%
#   gm_html_body(
#     '<h1>A plot of <b>MotorTrend</b> data <i>(1974)</i></h1>
#     <br><img src="cid:foobar">') %>%
#   gm_attach_file("mtcars.png", id = "foobar")

# unlink("mtcars.png")

## Uploading
### Create Draft

# You can upload any mime message into your gmail drafts using `gm_create_draft()`.  Be sure to give yourself at least `compose` permissions first.

#sending_messages_create_draft, eval=FALSE}
# gm_create_draft(file_attachment)

### Insert

# This inserts the message directly into your mailbox, bypassing gmail's default scanning and classification algorithms.

# gm_insert_message(file_attachment)

### Import

# This imports the email as though it was a normal message, with the same scanning and classification as normal email.

```{r sendingfileattachment, eval=FALSE}
# gm_insert_message(file_attachment)
```

```{r sendmailr, eval=FALSE}
library(sendmailR)

from <- sprintf("rees@reesmorrison.com","Rees Morrison") # the sender’s name is an optional value
to <- sprintf("iamwillmorrison@gmail.com")
subject <- "Test email subject"
body <- "Test email body"

sendmail(from,to,subject,body,control=list(smtpServer="smtp.gmail.com"))
# Error in if (code == lcode) { : argument is of length zero

```

```{r mailr}
#library(mailR)  # requires Java
```

## Sending Message

You can also send an email message directly from a `mime` object using `gm_send_message()`.

gm_auth_configure()
gm_send_message(text_msg)


```{r sending_messages_clenup, include=FALSE}
unlink("iris.csv")
```
