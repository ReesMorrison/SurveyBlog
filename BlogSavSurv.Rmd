# How to create individual posts

Start RStudio; Open the SurveyBlog project and load packages; call serve_site() [Need to be in the right directory, Hornbooks/5Survey etc.  I shut down R and started afresh and the right directory followed the project]  A pop came up on 2/1`/24 about Windows Firewall blocking.  I clicked Yes

Click on New Post dropdown from Addins, which runs this: blogdown:::new_post_addin().

<!-- https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/ -->

  Name the post: 
  Category  Surveys (or maybe new line indented - Surveys)
  Tags delete 
  Slug ignore 
  output: pdf_document   should I add this?
  With the radio button at the bottom keep Format: Markdown (I did .Rmd)
  
  File/Rename [core idea, no spaces] and save the new .md or .Rmd with code
  Draft: replace "yes" with no -- no quote marks

KEY delete the index file from SurveyBlog/content/post for the post to publish

  Copy and paste in the text 
  Add packages chunk at the top if there is R code
  Add data chunk to read in, for example, ukrAll, if needed
  Remove \newpage
  insert at end of post <!-- End of post -->  
  
  Make changes on my laptop in the .md file  Useful site https://www.spanishdict.com/answers/152876/line-breaks-pictures-links-and-other-formatting-tricks-#Single
  
## Pushing posts to GitHub, which then sends them to Netlify and the blog 

Connect to GH: click "Git" above Pane 3, and "Commit" button (check mark, CTRL-ALT-M)

Stage files listed on the left pane by checking, which is usually all of them to either add or delete [D].  Ctrl-A picks all and then click one

Fill in Comment of what has been done, or any random typing.  The "Commit" lozenge is below
[click on box under "Staged" in Git at top right], Commit to GH
Push to GH [still "branch is one commit ahead of main"].  "Stop"
Then click "Close"

On GitHub, if I go to SurveyBlog/public/post/ I can see all the posts.  My 2/1/24 post did not make it.

Render is the hosting software.  To make sure Render is working: Go to render.com and login.  "Dashboard" on upper right and I chose GitHub

2/1/24 


Manual Deploy in purple box to upper right -- takes 15 seconds and should end with "==> Your site is live!"

Tracking hits is https://savvysurveys.goatcounter.com/


# How to put blog posts into the Guide

Open SavSurvGuideLean.Rmd file in 5Surveys/surveyBook when in project what?

insert colon at end of title

Put in R chunk (but it must be an RMD:

knitr::include_graphics("C:/Users/rees/Documents/R/Projects/LAWYER Hornbooks/5Surveys/SavSurvBlog/SurveyBlog/static/media/RStudio Screenshot Scripts Post.png")

If the image isn’t generated by R, fig.width and fig.height are redundant
Use PNG for R graphics output, and high-resolution if you plan to print.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;  [three &nbsp] indents a paragraph

turn hyperlinks in text into footnotes for PDF output, because readers will not be able to click the links (generated from \href{URL}{text}).  See https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown-cookbook/latex-preamble.html

blogdown creates a file structure in XX/ that includes these folders:

  content (where blog is)
  layouts (css and js) # https://makewithhugo.com/minify-and-load-css-through-hugo/
  R [haven't used]
  resources [haven't used]
  static (media) .pngs and other images

  Check for bold of key terms, using **...**
  Insert images with the Addins drop down
  Insert URLs as [underlined text](URL)   NB no space
<!-- Insert images from the static/media subfolder using ![](/media/picture_vacations.png)  or .jpg -->
  {width=50%, height=20%} didn't work in .md files but does in .Rmd.  Note that there is no space.  Opened image in Paint and resized to 70.  So I right clicked on the image and chose "Edit" and resized.  With the Absinthe painting the original was about 650px by 850.  I reduced it to 60% and saved, but no difference when I ran the post. 
  No quotes on file path, no need for directories above BlogThemes1.  Underline turns blue when I do correct syntax.  
  
    Run Check Spelling… in RStudio (under Edit menu)
    Run xfun::optipng() on the directory where the post’s images are stored (including plots output by R) for lossless reduction of the size of .png images  [RWM for jpg?]
    Run W3C Link Checker on the post preview to make sure all links are valid.
    Check images have alt text. A web accessibility evaluation tool can help.  [https://www.w3.org/WAI/ER/tools/]

  Save the .md file and check that the changes took (then commit to GitHub).  You can immediately view changes with every save using LiveReload and your .html file is properly output. Changes are local.  Viewer shows what a user sees on the site. 

  Save the URL of post on blog by right clicking title and "Copy link location"; save the long URL in this file
  Get the Bitly short form and add it after the full URL (on Bitly, click "Create" orange tab, then "Link".  Paste in long form and click "copy" to save short form; save below long form)
  
blogdown::check_site() will run all check_*() functions at once. 
    
config.toml has many options, such as changing the name of the site!

# Creating a blog with Hugo, blogdown, Netlify

## changes to the blog site

Hugo builds the website pages out of blocks of code. If you are using a straightforward theme like I am then the file at: /hugo_root/themes/theme/layouts/_default/single.html

is the file that builds the pages. This does not contain most of the HTML that will end up in the final page, rather, it contains calls to other files that contain the needed HTML. Notably, the header.html and footer.html files.

If we want to add some custom HTML into the page header then we will need to add it to the header.html or include a call to another file that does contain the HTML. We will do that latter as it will be much easier to keep everything neat if we put the Google Analytics code in its own file.

useful:  rstudioapi::navigateToFile("config.yaml") or pick any file

Under /Themes/BlogThemes found config.yaml and changed a number of features, including title, author, some page names

/BlogThemes/themes/hugo-tanka (changed in early April 2021 to hugo-texify)

look in Themes by using Files in Pane 4, and find config.  One is params.toml

When Hugo builds the blog, the final html files and structure go into the public folder. This is the static version of the blog and the one we will deploy to our domain.

```{r blogSetup}
# new_site(theme = "nanxstats/hugo-tanka", force = TRUE)  
# FEATUREs of Hugo Tanka at https://awesomeopensource.com/project/nanxstats/hugo-tanka

# try URL 'https://github.com/wowchemy/wowchemy-hugo-modules/archive/25e0b0627f09.tar.gz'

### Learn about HUGO
https://ropensci.org/blog/2019/01/09/hugo/

### Blog color scheme colorBrewer palette Dark2https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss3_flexbox_justify-content_space-around   Try out your code

.customBlogTitle in index.css  h1   and header.html
navbarLink in common.css       h2   and header.html and header.html, I changed to "center"
.customPostTitle in index.css  h3
subthemes in common.css        h4

add extra line
To add an extra line of space between paragraphs, add the HTML &nbsp; code, followed by two extra spaces (e.g. &nbsp.., replacing the periods with spaces).

I used this: https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Dark2&n=3

27,158,119  dark green for Blog Title  
217,95,2    orangy-red for tabs ()
117,112,179 purplish for blog titles   
            subthemes link
            
### Blog text font size, color and css cascading style sheets
Note: If you do not specify a font size, the default size for normal text, like paragraphs, is 16px (16px=1em).

BlogTitle
Navbar
PostTitle

### Tabs at top of blog (Navbar): Services

about.md to modify the About tab. 

services.md for my selling pitch 

# Sidebar to list related blogs
https://discourse.gohugo.io/t/how-would-i-create-a-sidebar-with-page-specific-related-links/9037/4

### create a form
I used Formspree to make a contact form, which is an online service (managed on GitHub) that allows you to add an HTML form to your static site. No registration, just use the form and confirm your email address once. I added the following code into my contact widget: 
https://alison.rbind.io/post/2017-06-12-up-and-running-with-blogdown/

## Create box for icons
config.toml has in it the elements below the blog title, such as About, Art, Themes, and Subthemes.  They have weights that determine their order.

I created an Icon element to practice boxes and made it weight 5

In BlogThemes1/content I created icon.Rmd

# domain names of savvysurveysjd.com is with namecheap; expires May 21, 2024

## One-time steps for GH, NetLify etc.  

<!-- Created GH repository ("BlogThemes"), joined NetLify and linked GH to it, installed blogdown package, picked the HugoTanka theme (modified it, later switched to TeXify) -->

Later, created GH repository SurveyBlog.  Linked it to Render [Your service is always available at https://surveyjds.onrender.com.].  But in GH, /content/post shows posts in reverse chrono order

https://alison.rbind.io/post/new-year-new-blogdown/   [Has three other posts and is excellent!]  She wrote the following before:  https://alison.rbind.io/post/2020-12-27-blogdown-checks/

    I am strongly in favour of never using .Rmd in a blogdown site because its output is an html file, not a .markdown/.md file. from  [RWM but what about inline code?] https://masalmon.eu/2020/02/29/hugo-maintenance/
 
    use .md so Hugo converts to html, but need to edit profile  https://drmowinckels.io/blog/2020-05-25-changing-you-blogdown-workflow/  also need to add archetype to YAML
    Third post Alison cites is too complicated https://clauswilke.com/blog/2020/09/08/a-blogdown-post-for-the-ages/


### Google Analytics

https://statsandr.com/blog/track-blog-performance-in-r/   Antoine!

What R package handles Google analytics data?  This one lists several others!  do a comparison?
https://code.markedmondson.me/googleAnalyticsR/

Account Id
188088269 (which is different from the User Authorization code)

```{r googleAnalytics, eval=FALSE}
library(googleAnalyticsR)

# https://www.rubenvezzoli.online/googleanalyticsr-beginners-guide/

# Connect R and Google Analytics: I chose Allow across all of them
# ga_auth()

ga_id <- 188088269


# PROPERTY ID  in Admin/Property Settings, which I searched for after online research

# fourth effort, based on this SO Question
# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14525565/not-sufficient-permissions-google-analytics-api-service-account
# Same issue. Solved it by using the VIEW id instead of the account Id (UA-XXXXX-1).
# 
# Analytics Console > Admin -> View (Profile) -> View Settings -> View ID
# 
# Make sure that you add the service account to your list of users in the Google Analytics Console. Simply setting it up in the Credentials, API and Permissions section of the developer console will still not grant it access to your analytics.
# 
# Analytics Console > Admin -> Account -> User Management -> "Add permissions for:"  RWM what is the service account I need to add?

Google Analytics Export Data and Analyze

```{r GAReports, echo=FALSE, eval=FALSE}
# Pick the custom date range, starting April 11, 2021.  Upper right, click on Share this report (middle icon) and export CSV, but save it as XLSX in BlogThemes1

GAData <- readxl::read_xlsx(path = "C:/Users/Rees Morrison/Documents/R/Projects/CLIENTS/Themes/BlogThemes1/GoogleAnalyticsExport.xlsx")

# I think all the numbers are New Users

GAData$NewUsers <- GAData$none + GAData$referral + GAData$organic


```

## analyze Bitly data with r

```{r bitly, eval=FALSE}
# library(urlshorteneR)  # this shortens URLs, but doesn't help with bitly
# bitly_auth()

# https://stackoverflow.com/questions/11493425/accessing-the-bitly-oauth2-api-from-r   maybe overkill for me

bitlyAll<- read_xlsx("C:/Users/Rees Morrison/Documents/R/Projects/CLIENTS/Themes/Bitly data.xlsx", sheet = "transpose2")

# colnames(bitlyAll) <- rep(c("Date", "Post", "URL", "Clicks"), 124)  # I named in Excel, which autonumbered

# EMAIL notices emayili

https://mvaugoyeau.netlify.app/post/presentation-off-women-international-day/#sending-the-support-with-the-package-sendmailr

https://bensstats.wordpress.com/2020/07/23/robservations-2-mail-merging-email-blasting-with-r/ with emayili

A web browser uses HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) to communicate with a web server. Similarly, an email client (like Outlook or Thunderbird) uses SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) as the communication protocol to send emails.

```{r email, eval=FALSE}
# emayili sending email with minimal dependencies. https://datawookie.github.io/emayili/
library(emayili)

# First create a message object.  Start here and delete the existing email, or it will repeat text
email <- envelope()

# Add addresses for the sender and recipient.
email <- email %>%
  from("rees@reesmorrison.com") %>%
  to("rees@reesmorrison.com", "iamwillmorrison@gmail.com")

# There are also bcc() and reply() functions for setting the Bcc and Reply-To fields.

# Add a subject.
email <- email %>% subject("Sending to Two!")

# Add a text body. You can use html() to add an HTML body.
email <- email %>% text("The latest topic covers Time.  It draws on a poem by Andrew Marvell, a movie with Bill Murray, a painting by Degas, and a song by The Byrds.  Please let me know your thoughts and observations.")

# Add an attachment.
# email <- email %>% attachment("image.jpg")  # excel file?

# Create a SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server object and send the message.
# How do I get the password and is my gmail address my user name
# More information about this service can be found at https://www.smtpbucket.com/.
# Google's server listens for secure connections on ports 465 and 587.

# email

smtp <- server(host = "smtp.gmail.com",
               port = 465,  # the SSL port
               username = "rees@reesmorrison.com",
               password = "vlmaxexlnnfpjtkn")   # we set up 2FA (factor authentication with my gmail account and it generated this random password)

# If you are using SSL, the port number is usually 465 and for TLS the port is usually 587. Even so, it's very easy to get hung up on the server details… Especially, when you try both and it doesn't work. This is most common with the major webmail services (e.g, Gmail, Yahoo, etc), because they use a different protocol by default, STARTTLS. 

smtp(msg = email)  # error  Login denied
# 535-5.7.8 Username and Password not accepted. Learn more at

# Simply printing a message displays the header information.

# qp_encode(c(Rees, Will))

# You can identify emails which have been sent using {emayili} by the presence of an X-Mailer header which includes both the package name and version.
# 
# To see the guts of the message as passed to the SMTP server:
#   print(email, details = TRUE)
# 
# Using STARTTLS
# 
# If you're trying to send email with a host that uses the STARTTLS security protocol (like Google Mail), then it will most probably be blocked due to insufficient security. In order to circumvent this, you can grant access to less secure apps. See the links below for specifics:
#   
#   Google (details)
# 
 
# other R packages which also send emails:
  
# blastula
# blatr (Windows)
# gmailr
# mail
# mailR
# sendmailR
# ponyexpress
```


```{r packagegmailr, eval=FALSE}
# Sending Messages With Gmailr"

library(gmailr)

## Constructing a MIME message
## Text First we will construct a simple text only message

text_msg <- gm_mime() %>%
  gm_to("rees@reesmorrison.com") %>%
  gm_from("rees@reesmorrison.com") %>%
  gm_text_body("Gmailr is a very handy package!")

# You can convert the message to a properly formatted MIME message using `as.character()`.
# Multipurpose Internet Mail Extensions (MIME) is an Internet standard that extends the format of email messages to support text in character sets other than ASCII, as well as attachments of audio, video, images, and application programs.
# 
# ```{r sending_messages_simple_print}
# strwrap(as.character(text_msg))

# You can also construct html messages.  It is customary to provide a text only message along with the html message, but with modern email clients this is not strictly necessary.

# html_msg <- gm_mime() %>%
#   gm_to("james.f.hester@gmail.com") %>%
#   gm_from("me@somewhere.com") %>%
#   gm_html_body("<b>Gmailr</b> is a <i>very</i> handy package!")

### Attachments

# You can add attachments to your message in two ways.
# 
# 1. If the data is in a file, use `gm_attach_file()`.  The mime type is automatically guessed by `mime::guess_type`, or you can specify it yourself with the `type` parameter.

# write.csv(file = "iris.csv", iris)
# 
# msg <- html_msg %>%
#   gm_subject("Here are some flowers") %>%
#   gm_attach_file("iris.csv")


# 2. If the data are already loaded into R, you can use `gm_attach_part()` to attach the binary data to your file.
# sending_messages_attachments_1}
# <!-- msg <- html_msg %>% -->
# <!--   gm_attach_part(part = charToRaw("attach me!"), name = "please") -->


# <!-- ### Including images -->

# <!-- You can also add use attached images in HTML by setting the Content ID feature of mime emails. This can be done by referencing the image via a `<img -->
# <!-- src=cid:xyz>` tag using the `id` argument of `send_file()`. The tag value can by any unique identifier. E.g. here is an example of including a ggplot2 image -->

# First create a plot to send, and save it to mtcars.png
# mtcars$gear <- as.factor(mtcars$gear)
# 
# png("mtcars.png", width = 400, height = 400, pointsize = 12)
# with(mtcars,
#      plot(hp,
#           mpg,
#           col = as.factor(gear),
#           pch = 19,
#           xlab = "Horsepower",
#           ylab = "Miles / gallon"
#      )
# )
# legend("topright", title = "# gears",
#        pch = 19,
#        col = seq_along(levels(mtcars$gear)),
#        legend = levels(mtcars$gear)
# )
# dev.off()

# Next create an HTML email that references the plot as 'foobar'
# email <- gm_mime() %>%
#   gm_to('someaddress@somewhere.com') %>%
#   gm_from("someaddress@somewhere.com") %>%
#   gm_subject("Cars report") %>%
#   gm_html_body(
#     '<h1>A plot of <b>MotorTrend</b> data <i>(1974)</i></h1>
#     <br><img src="cid:foobar">') %>%
#   gm_attach_file("mtcars.png", id = "foobar")

# unlink("mtcars.png")

## Uploading
### Create Draft

# You can upload any mime message into your gmail drafts using `gm_create_draft()`.  Be sure to give yourself at least `compose` permissions first.

#sending_messages_create_draft, eval=FALSE}
# gm_create_draft(file_attachment)

### Insert

# This inserts the message directly into your mailbox, bypassing gmail's default scanning and classification algorithms.

# gm_insert_message(file_attachment)

### Import

# This imports the email as though it was a normal message, with the same scanning and classification as normal email.

```{r sendingfileattachment, eval=FALSE}
# gm_insert_message(file_attachment)
```

```{r sendmailr, eval=FALSE}
library(sendmailR)

from <- sprintf("rees@reesmorrison.com","Rees Morrison") # the sender’s name is an optional value
to <- sprintf("iamwillmorrison@gmail.com")
subject <- "Test email subject"
body <- "Test email body"

sendmail(from,to,subject,body,control=list(smtpServer="smtp.gmail.com"))
# Error in if (code == lcode) { : argument is of length zero

```

```{r mailr}
#library(mailR)  # requires Java
```

## Sending Message

You can also send an email message directly from a `mime` object using `gm_send_message()`.

gm_auth_configure()
gm_send_message(text_msg)


```{r sending_messages_clenup, include=FALSE}
unlink("iris.csv")
```

## Six Ways to plot binary

```{r binary, eval=FALSE}
binary <- data.frame(Answer = c("Yes", "No"),
                     Pct = c(0.60, 0.40))

column <- ggplot(binary, aes(x = Answer, y = Pct)) + 
  geom_col(width = 0.7) +
  labs(x = "Answer", y = "Pct.", title = "Bar Chart") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2), labels = scales::percent_format())
column


stacked <- ggplot(binary, aes(x="", y=Pct, fill=Answer)) +
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity")
stacked 

pie <- ggplot(binary, aes(x = "", y = Pct, fill = Answer)) + 
  geom_bar(width = 1, stat = "identity") +
  coord_polar("y", start = 0) +
  labs(x = "Answer", y = "Pct.", title = "Bar Chart") +
  scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2), labels = percent_format())
pie

fan.df <- data.frame(Answers = c(rep("Yes", 20), rep("No", 8)))

# library(ggfan)  # doesn't look like a fan plot
# fan <- ggplot(fan.df, aes(x = Answers)) + 
#   geom_fan(intervals = intervals) +
#   labs(x = "Answer", y = "Pct.", title = "Fanplot") +
#   scale_y_continuous(breaks = seq(0, 1, 0.2), labels = percent_format())
# fan

```

Adherents of fanplots maintain that they are a better alternative to pie charts. They represent amounts of values.  The traditional pie plot is difficult for most people to interpret, because humans are not trained well to observe and interpret angles.  This fan plot was generated by the plotrix package and its fan.plot function.  

```{r fanplot, eval=FALSE}
library(plotrix)   # for fanplot of DataVisualizations

fan.plot(x = binary$Pct, max.span = pi, main = "Fanplot", labels = TRUE)

```
