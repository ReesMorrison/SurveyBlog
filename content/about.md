The posts on this site address the issues raised by modest-size online surveys.  Written for lawyers and those who work with lawyers, it strives to be clear, practical, and well-written.

I write about the challenges I encounter in my projects, and about other topics that pertain to such surveys.

The bold terms indicate common survey terminology.
