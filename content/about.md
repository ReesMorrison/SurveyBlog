The posts on this site address the issues raised by modest-size online surveys.  Written for lawyers and those who work with lawyers who want to conduct successful surveys, this blog strives to be clear, well-written, and practical.

I write about the challenges I encounter in my projects, and about other topics that pertain to law-related surveys.  The bold terms indicate common survey terminology. At some point I plan to consolidate the posts into a guidebook that will be available on LeanPub.
