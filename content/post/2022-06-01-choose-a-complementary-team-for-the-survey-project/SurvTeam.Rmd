For a flourishing **survey project**, assemble a team whose members contribute balanced and complementary talents.  It doesn’t take a village, but it takes at least a handful of contributors.  Different viewpoints and skills should be committed to the success of the project.

Remember, the information you hope to collect from the effort needs to be generally acknowledged as objective – not biased toward or against pre-ordained conclusions – and comprehensive – covering the topics that most recipients of the report would like to see explored.  Thus, the team should strive for representative balance and thorough coverage.  

Management scholars, executives, and consultants have written overwhelmingly about solid teams and what makes them tick.  Let me therefore modestly note a few characteristics that seem crucial for a **survey project team**.  

•	The team should be willing and able to think through the tools and timing of their effort, including the costs and contributions of team members.  They need a modicum of project management skills.
•	The team needs to deliberate on the questions and who will be asked to respond to them; what areas of inquiry will be plumbed and how the answers will be aggregated and presented.  They need a solid grasp of the survey’s purpose and who will learn what from the effort.  These are all challenging topics that a committed and varied team confronts.

•	Perhaps the most difficult challenge is obtaining sufficient time for the team members to perform well.  Members are busy and likely to have different – or even conflicting – priorities and goals.  No matter how you spin it, the time is non-billable, administrative time, which comes at a premium.  To carve out blocks of time for all team members to meet … that’s hard.

•	The members need to have a modicum of interest in either the information sought from the survey, the methodology, the instrumental sue of the survey, and ideally all those areas.  

•	Law firm and legal department teams will most likely fall short in survey methodology (good questionnaire design, statistical robustness, data visualization) but probably not in making sense of the data.  A **consultant** can strengthen a team with experience on methodology, obstacles, and tools: match the knowledge of the sponsor team as to its goals and areas of inquiry with the process and software skills of the consultant.  A consultant might know little about partner compensation or paralegal morale or time allocation, but they should know tasks and timing, as well as how to create and deploy an online instrument with a **survey tool**, how to process the returned data and visualize it with graphs, and how to package a report.

•	The team should not be dominated by any member: not the General Counsel or the Managing Partner, to whom team members may unwarrantedly defer.

At the risk of generalizing too much, consider a hypothetical five-person team.  Person A is senior, thinks long-term and knows the history and culture of those to be surveyed; Person B is more junior, in touch with the “newer generation”, perhaps more likely to want change in the status quo; Person C is comfortable with math and Excel; Person D writes clearly and cares passionately about the whether the survey project brings about meaningful change; and Person E is known as a maverick thinker, a precise and careful person, and a capable project manager and chair.  An adept chairperson, respected by the members, goes a long way to harness the requisite skills and navigate the shoals of team performance.
