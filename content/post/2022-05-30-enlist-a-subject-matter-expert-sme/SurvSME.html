<p>No survey should be released into the wild without the thoughtful input of a person who knows in depth the domain of the survey, a <strong>subject matter expert (SME) </strong>. Put positively, embed as an integral contributor to your <strong>project team</strong> someone who knows deeply what they’re talking about regarding the <strong>survey topic</strong>. Mostly, SMEs surface from with the law firm, law department, or legal vendor behind the survey, but an outside resource might be retained.</p>
<p>I was reminded of this imperative when I prepared a survey of the executive directors of law firms. In a list of items for a <strong>multiple-choice question</strong>, I ignorantly used the term “Certified Professional Accountant, CPA”: my SME admonished me to correct it to “Certified Public Accountant, CPA.” Likewise, in a list of executives to whom the Executive Director might report, I included the Chief Financial Officer, only to be advised that no Executive Director of a law firm would report to that position.</p>
<p>“Expert,” to be sure, sets a high bar. You would not want to discourage a person who has considerable experience or familiarity with the survey topic from pitching in because they do not want to hold themselves out as so accomplished. Also, presumably the <strong>sponsor</strong> and other members of your project team hold those positions because they know about (or at least are concerned about) the topic.</p>
<p>The highest value of a subject matter expert comes in regard to a survey’s questions. That specialist might tell you whether a question is worded the way respondents understand. Does it use the right jargon and tone, and does it avoid novel, confusing, or ambiguous terms?</p>
<p>They can judge whether <strong>priority questions</strong> are reasonable. Has the survey covered the likely answers in the items of a multiple-choice questions? Or has it included items that no one will realistically choose? Or, they might point out that several items could simultaneously apply, so the question format should be <strong>pick-all-that-apply</strong>.</p>
<p>An SME can warn the survey designer that a question has no realistic answer, or that it requires digging up data (<strong>research</strong>) or tackling a trivial, non-controversial point. With their expertise, you can avoid the dreaded unknown unknowns, such as the difference between a JD degree from law school and an admitted lawyer who has passed a state bar exam. At the back end of a survey project, interpretation always happens more smoothly and perspicaciously when there is a subject matter expert at the wheel.</p>
<p>Furthermore, an SME may well suggest a thoughtful question that you would not have come up with in the design of the survey. They know what is cutting edge and what is dulled edge.</p>
<p>They also can contribute when they put the survey through its paces before it is released (pre-test it). Perhaps they will suggest a crisper instruction to a question, or even rearrangement of the order of questions.</p>
<p>Whatever the role of your SME, you should recognize and thank them in the <strong>acknowledgements</strong>. Acknowledgements should include any contributors and should be thought of as part of your <strong>methodology</strong> summary.</p>
