    <p><strong>Poems</strong> tell miniature stories, as do <strong>song lyrics</strong>, <strong>paintings</strong> and scenes in <strong>movies</strong>. The stories in each art form suggest a range of cultural concepts. For example, a collection of one piece from each art form might make the careful viewer aware of a tangible feature shared by each of them, such as a hat or a factory, or perhaps an abstraction such as suffering or hope. But this notion of stories with a common theme across art forms extends more broadly.</p>
<p>All art, including the creative activities we call poetry, song-writing, painting, and filming, opens us to a multitude of themes of the human condition. We can spot themes across art forms, and those shared themes and subthemes can stimulate varied perspectives from the different genre.</p>
<p>That goal animates the clusters of five posts on this blog: <strong>to explore a theme shared by a quartet of an Impressionist painting, a poem in English, a rock song, and a movie scene</strong>. Careful consideration of the piece chosen from each genre draws out sub-themes from them. Along with the four posts that concentrate on each art form in the quartet, a fifth post adds additional subthemes that span the individual observations or find no anchor in any of the pieces of art.</p>
<p>If you have read this far, you may wonder who I am and why am I writing this blog. During my career in the U.S. as a lawyer and then for three decades as a management consultant to lawyers, I read a fair amount of poetry, collected and admired hundreds of postcards of impressionist paintings, relished the rock music of the &rsquo;60s and &lsquo;70&rsquo;s, and watched movies throughout. It also gives me pleasure to write, to engage in a &ldquo;project&rdquo; &ndash; as this has turned out to be &ndash; and to play around with ideas &ndash; themes and subthemes. Having found just such a mix of familiar culture, an opportunity to put thoughts into writing, and tools from the platform of R software and other open-source offerings (GitHub, Hugo, NetLify), it&rsquo;s been engrossing to make Themes from Art a reality that keeps developing. I&rsquo;d love to hear from you. <strong>Please write me if you have any comments or questions</strong>: rees(AT)reesmorrison(DOT).com</p>
