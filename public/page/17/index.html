      Designers of surveys by law firms, law departments, or legal vendors use a slew of names for the capability of an online survey to jump to a question based on the answer to a previous question. The names designers give to this kind of question include ‚Äúskip logic,‚Äù ‚Äúbranching,‚Äù and ‚Äúconditional‚Äù questions; I will use the term conditional question. Conditional questions create a custom path through a survey because the answer to one question (or more than one) dictates what the next question (or a later question) asks or how it is structured.

      A respectable survey conducted by a law firm, law department, or legal vendor gives respondents ample opportunity not only to pick items from selections or prioritize items but also to expand on their ideas. They add their own thoughts in text boxes, which often accompany multiple-choice questions that have an ‚ÄúOther‚Äù choice. Or free text might emanate from open-ended questions like ‚ÄúHow do you feel about the training you have been offered for confrontation management?

      When a law firm or a law department launches an online survey, the invitation email should include a projected closing date. ‚ÄúWe urge you to take the survey on or before May 31st.‚Äù For internal surveys by firms and legal teams, two to three weeks should be sufficient to accommodate holidays as well as employee vacations, illnesses, technical glitches in the hosted software, procrastination, or stretches of high-pressure workloads.
The psychology of setting a date motivates people to put it on their to-do list.

      The data analyzed in a survey project consists of three kinds: attitudes and answers that only the respondents know; extensions of that data, such as index variables, categorized continuous variables, coded comments, or calculated variables (such as fully loaded internal costs per hour); and thirdly, supplemental information that the sponsor stirs into the mix. Thus, human data, software data (so to speak), and external data.
Like Christmas trees padded with attached branches, supplemental data fills out the analyses.

      For a flourishing survey project, assemble a team whose members contribute balanced and complementary talents. It doesn‚Äôt take a village, but it takes at least a handful of contributors. Different viewpoints and skills from the legal team or law firm should be committed to the success of the project.
Remember, the information you aim to collect from the online survey needs to be generally acknowledged as objective ‚Äì not biased toward or against pre-ordained conclusions ‚Äì and comprehensive ‚Äì covering the topics that most recipients of the report would like to see explored.
