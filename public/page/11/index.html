      When you present survey data, you can choose among five primary modes: text, lists, tables, charts, or infographics. Each serves a different purpose and demands different skills from those who use them. Each mode has its strengths and weaknesses. Let‚Äôs consider them in order of their difficulty to implement.
Text has the obvious advantages of being easy to produce and readily understood. With word-processing, you can apply bold, underline, italics and size to emphasize different numbers, but mostly it is a strung-along verbal description of numbers.

      We can cite several advantages to using online surveys for data collection:
  Respondent convenience: Online surveys can be accessed from any device with an internet connection, which makes it easy for respondents to complete the survey at their convenience.
  Cost-effective: Online surveys are less expensive to administer than traditional paper-based surveys, as they do not require printing or mailing costs. As compared to mailed surveys, you also know more about whether a survey reached its recruitment target when you send out emails.

      When a survey analyst sits down to corral and curry the data from a survey, one of the first steps would typically be to rename some or all of the variables. You do that so that they are intelligible and so that they are short. Assuming you use the variable in your code or graphics, you want it to be called ‚ÄúTitle‚Äù, not ‚ÄúPlease pick from the drop-down below the title that is most equivalent to yours.

      At the end of my surveys, a message box thanks the person who just completed it and asks them to send me an email confirming that submission. When someone emails you after they have completed your survey, at the least you confirm their e-mail address. More substantially, it makes it easier for you to write to them if a problem arises with their response, such as a missing required value or a puzzling comment.

      When you conduct a survey on behalf of a law firm or legal vendor, it might be shrewd to team with others who do not compete with you for purposes of expanding your outreach, whom we will refer to as a ‚Äúcollaborator.‚Äù A collaborator may see it in their interest to promote their name in the survey and thereby gather information and contacts that are useful to them. They might agree to e-mail a survey invitation to their proprietary mailing lists and contacts; everyone wins!
