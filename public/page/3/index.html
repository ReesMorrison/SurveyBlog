      When you send out invitation emails, every now and then one of your potential participants wants to know something about the survey project or about you. This doesn&rsquo;t happen often, but before they start filling in the questionnaire answers, people raise points or bump into concerns along the lines of the following.
Anonymity: What I have encountered most commonly is that they want to understand the steps you will take to preserve the confidentiality of their answers.

      Most sponsors churn out external surveys primarily for their marketing advantages. They invest time and money as they would for other forms of public relations, market awareness, thought leadership, member benefits, and publicity. A portion of sponsors, however, realize that their extensive efforts to collect, clean and publish useful information need not be done for free; surveys can produce revenue.
The most common way that sponsors earn money from a survey is to charge for the report.

      When a law department polls its own members or clients (employees who ask the legal department for services) or when a law firm polls its lawyers or staff, those are what I call internal surveys. They take place withing the walls of the firm or department. We have no way of knowing how many internal surveys take place in the United States. I have done dozens as parts of consulting projects, but I can‚Äôt extrapolate, and I‚Äôve never seen data about the frequency of the non-public facing practice of conducting surveys.

      The starting point, the sine qua non, of survey projects that get off the ground are adequate lists of e-mail addresses. The more people you can reach through your bulk e-mail software, the more likely your survey is to build up a sufficient participant base.
Large email lists are not always a prerequisite, because focused surveys may know their population and not need to supplement their e-mail addresses. For example, any internal survey by a law firm or law department exemplifies that.

      Sponsors of a new survey, whether or not they have previously conducted a survey, always want to know: ‚ÄúHow long will the project take?‚Äù From the jumping off point when the firm, vendor or legal department decides to proceed with a survey, how long might a sponsor reasonably anticipate it will take before the final report is published?
Internal surveys by a law firm or law department can be pulled off relatively quickly.
