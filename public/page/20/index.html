      When your internet survey has a question that generates a string of numbers as long as the number of your respondents, such as if 100 law departments report their fees paid to outside counsel or hours committed to pro bono work, you have collected what analysts call a continuous variable. ‚ÄúContinuous‚Äù is statistician and programmer parlance for ‚Äúnumbers, with or without decimals.‚Äù The term says nothing about the order of the numbers or whether there are gaps or clusters.

      We have already discussed invitations to potential participants sent by email. If the survey is conducted within a law firm or law department, all the invitees‚Äô addresses are at hand. If, however, you are a vendor or consultant who wants to survey firms or departments, you want to reach as many as possible beyond a kernel email list that you have developed yourself. Let‚Äôs consider a number of techniques to increase your email reach.

      Before you unleash your survey into the wild, delay long enough to allow at least one thoughtful person to attack the draft survey, as if he or she were an idiot. More specifically, ask a lawyer (or someone from the group to be surveyed) to review your survey work who is a peer or above so that they are not reluctant to criticize, ask tough questions, disagree, or find fault. Push them to answer all the questions as if they were dumb, unmindful, or a saboteur.

      When writing about online survey construction and analysis, I use the term ‚Äúdemographics‚Äù to describe the data collected about the person or organization that is responding. Not the insightful and new information that is aimed for, such as attitudes, rankings, percentage of agreement, and open text, but descriptive facts about the respondent. Demographic data include title, office location, education, years of experience, and gender, for individuals and revenue, employees, patents, headquarters country, and offices for organizations.

    <div class="content">
      
      <p>Once you have figured out whom to invite for a survey of your law firm, law department, or organization, you need to let them know the survey is open and waiting, and that you would sincerely like them to take it.  Nearly every <strong>sponsor</strong> does so by sending an <strong>invitational email</strong>.   They might have to turn to a mailing list all ready to deploy (‚ÄúAll-Department‚Äù), or they might have to use <strong>bulk-mailing software</strong> such as Constant Contact or MailChimp.  Ideally, several readers will have critiqued the draft email for how well it frames and energizes the survey project.</p>
