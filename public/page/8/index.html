      When you ask a question on a survey and give respondents several answers to select from, you can present those selections in varied formats. Those choices of format do not change if the question allows for only a single choice or for multiple choices, e.g., ‚ÄúChoose all that apply.‚Äù
If you present survey-takers with only a few choices, you might spread them horizontally across the questionnaire page. Or you might list them vertically.

      How can you gain insights from written answers or comments in surveys? Among the many tools, let‚Äôs focus on a popular one to ferret out elusive themes in text, called topic modeling.
Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) is an unsupervised1 machine learning algorithm for topic modeling: identifying sets of words that characterize topics that might not be obvious ‚Äì they are ‚Äúlatent‚Äù. The algorithm uses a probability distribution, the Dirichlet distribution, to allocate comments to topics and words to topics: thus, Latent Dirichlet Allocation.

      If you ask a seemingly simple question of law firm or law department lawyers such as, ‚ÄúWhat was your total cash compensation in the last fiscal year?‚Äù, the format of the answers you receive will be far from simple. One person will enter ‚Äú$100,000,‚Äù another ‚Äúone hundred thousand,‚Äù a third will enter ‚Äú100,000 dollars,‚Äù while a fourth will put in ‚Äúwas $100,000.‚Äù Although a human knows instantly and correctly how to interpret each variation, they will confound your comparatively rigid computer.

      The most common measure in survey results of what statisticians call ‚Äúcentral tendency‚Äù is the average (the mean) of a set of numbers, such as the average number of paralegals in the responding law firms. The next most common measure is the median, the middle value when the set is sorted from high to low. Rarely you see the mode, which is the most common value in a set of numbers.

      My heart is committed to open-source software and code and my abiding faith rests with transparency in research: tell people what you did and how you did it and share as much data as you can so that your investigation is reproducible. Theoretically, others can retrace your steps and recreate your analytic conclusions. Openness and sharing help us all make faster progress in understanding our world.
That credo espoused, however, I must admit that many surveys in the legal industry have sponsors who do not wish to disclose much about their effort.
