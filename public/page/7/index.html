      Assuming you have amassed enough respondents to your survey, consider inviting them to attend a webinar. You can also leverage webinars to build your participant base by publicizing the webinar more broadly (although you can‚Äôt open the gates if you plan to share findings that people only deserve to get if they take part in the survey, such as compensation data). Even if someone has not completed the survey in time for the report and findings you discuss in the webinar, someone who attends will get to know you and your services from the webinar and thereport you send afterwards.

      Disclosure: I am a consultant who makes my living by selling my services to those who conduct surveys. Despite that challenge to my objectivity on the topic of consultants, I will presumptuously press on to address what I have experienced to be the pros and cons of retaining a consultant as a member of a survey project team. Being bullish on trained consultants, I will begin with benefits from retaining an experienced consultant.

      If you conduct a periodic survey, such as a morale and engagement survey every six months, you can reasonably expect that what people read in a report (assuming you publish the results) will influence their answers the next round. Perhaps only slightly, but respondents may recall or be influenced by their latent memory when they answer the next iteration of the survey.
This expectation presumes that you maintain the same wording of the question and the same instructions for how to answer.

      You can&rsquo;t make every question a required question, or respondents will likely feel bullied, vexed, and tempted to drop out. For many reasons, people leave answers blank (they don‚Äôt want to give that piece of data, can‚Äôt track it down quickly, only want to spend a few minutes on the survey, don‚Äôt have an opinion, don‚Äôt know the answer, never finished the questionnaire, or are not allowed to share the information).

      Surveyor sponsors sometimes weight their data to make the findings more representative of the underlying population. After all, a single survey only provides a partial sample of the entire group (the population), and it may have ‚Äúholes‚Äù or ‚Äúbulges‚Äù ‚Äì too few respondents of some kind or too many of another. This point comes through in an article in the New York Times, July 23, 2015, at 83 regarding political polls.
