      I dislike questions that ask takers of a survey to pick one of two choices – let’s call them binary questions. “Are you satisfied or are you not satisfied with the firm’s vacation policy?” The pair of choices is “Satisfied” and “Not Satisfied.” Surveyors should eschew that style of question for several reasons.
Paternalistic: The either/or format tries to do the thinking for the respondents. It is arrogant to believe that you can pick the only two alternatives that all or nearly all of them want to go with.

      Among the most sensitive questions a survey might present would be the seemingly simple “What is your gender?”. Years ago, no problem; with the current hyper-sensitivity to anything related to biological or behavioral expressions of sexuality, that is a thin-ice inquiry.
However, while your law firm or legal vendor should be acutely wary of asking for gender, you are not prohibited from guessing the gender of respondents if you know their first name.

      Categorical variables (aka “factors”) are limited text choices as answers, such as “Male” or “Female,” a state in the United States, or a title. For example, a recent survey I completed produced the following simplified table of data for 94 leaders in law firms. A categorical variable for title included “Chief”, “Director” and “Manager.” The size of the firm created a second categorical, in the AmLaw 100 or not in the AmLaw100.

      While developing a survey for a law firm about Work from Home policies (aka Return to Office), we arrived at a ranking question that included 16 potential advantages. That’s how many benefits to working from home we came up with (we developed close to that number of disadvantages, but no matter). The selections were so numerous that respondents might flag in their perusal of them, leading to primacy bias toward the first few selections being chosen more than they would have been if the selections were fewer.

      When you are a law firm or a law department that wants to invite a plentiful group of prospects to take a survey, you will undoubtedly rely on a** bulk mailing application**. My only experience has been with Constant Contact, but I suspect that the comments below apply to any number of comparable applications, e.g., Dotdigital, ActiveCampaign, Sendinblue, Mailerlite, and Klaviyo.
You can easily copy an invitation e-mail, make changes, and keep track of your different ”campaigns.
