      My heart is committed to open-source software and code and my abiding faith rests with transparency in research: tell people what you did and how you did it and share as much data as you can so that your investigation is reproducible. Theoretically, others can retrace your steps and recreate your analytic conclusions. Openness and sharing help us all make faster progress in understanding our world.
That credo espoused, however, I must admit that many surveys in the legal industry have sponsors who do not wish to disclose much about their effort.

      Here we are considering a different notion than disqualifying a response that you decide is not legitimate. The idea is that a recipient‚Äôs answers to a survey ‚Äì correct and complete though they may be ‚Äì should not be included in the survey data set. The person competently answered the questions, but they are not a person whose views are sought. For example, ALM‚Äôs 2012 survey of alternative fee arrangements explained in the report that 218 law firms responded, of which 194 were qualified.

      Here are several clues that suggest a respondent is merely trying to get the report but doesn‚Äôt deserve to because their answers were too weak or questionable. Clues can point you to suspects, but it is a good practice to write to them and inquire calmly and objectively about their dubious response. Perhaps they were rushed, misunderstood instructions, or were interrupted while replying. Who knows? Or perhaps they lack genuine bona fides.

      As soon as you have accumulated a few responses to your survey of law firms or law departments, you should download them and scrutinize them. It is far better to find and fix a problem early, or make a change that facilitates your analysis, than to proceed deep into the survey project. After all, we know what an ounce of prevention is worth. Here are several jagged edges to avoid.

      Toward the end of most academic articles, the authors reflect on the research that spawned the article and speculate on how they might have done better. They also predict how they would like to extend that research in various ways. It is a self-critical postmortem, and that practice suggests what survey sponsors should also do.
In the four topics below, I suggest general areas of self-analysis and reflection. The animating idea is objectivity improvement, and tough love.
