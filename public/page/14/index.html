      Here is the Table of Contents of the draft Report that we plan to send to all participants. The send date will be during the last week of August. We plan to publish an updated report, with data from respondents between late August and mid-October, shortly after the October closing date.
From the 129 respondents to date (with considerably more expected in the next few weeks), here are quartile figures for their total base and bonus compensation.

      Many designers of surveys like questions that ask respondents to indicate their opinion by choosing from a scale. Likert scale questions (named after their creator, American social scientist Rensis Likert) are popular because they are one of the most reliable ways to measure opinions, perceptions, and behaviors. Such topics can‚Äôt be understood with one question. Instead, you collect data on multiple indicators ‚Äî questions that help you understand the concept you‚Äôre trying to measure.

      From my point of view, all reports of survey results should include a fulsome methodology description. No matter if the sponsor is a law firm or a legal vendor, if the survey went outside of the organization for participants, the report should describe the project openly and transparently.
More specifically, the goals of a methodology section in a survey report are twofold. First, to let people determine whether your steps to handle the data of the survey sample were evenhanded, thought through, and carefully applied.

      If a survey by a law firm, department, or vendor were an academic major, then related to it would be many minors. Put differently, those who sponsor online surveys in the legal field need to till competently in the core acreage, but ancillary fields of knowledge stretch all around it. Or as the title‚Äôs metaphor suggests, survey know-how shines brightly in the center, while planets of associated knowledge circle around.

      A rule that admits no exception commands survey designers to end the selection items of a multiple-choice question with one item: ‚ÄúOther.‚Äù Survey experts hold much less adamant views regarding whether to tack on any or all questions a variation of ‚ÄúNot applicable‚Äù or ‚ÄúDon‚Äôt know enough to answer.‚Äù Yet for a respondent either of those choices may be the most appropriate on any given question.
If you don‚Äôt include them, the respondent may pick an item, but that choice is based on too little knowledge or too little relevance to that person.
