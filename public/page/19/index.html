      You should ask for the email address of the person responding to your survey on behalf of a law firm, law department or legal vendor. As to the order of that question, place it as one of the first questions because otherwise people who spend time slogging through the questionnaire might not want to find at the end that you want them to identify themselves, that they are not anonymous.

      A popular format on online surveys requests respondents to consider a list and assign priorities. ‚ÄúConsider the following challenges of work from home as compared to at the law firm:‚Äù could be the format of one such question; the list that follows has ‚Äúinadequate software, interruptions, noise, pets, social isolation, work-life balance, Other.‚Äù [Note that the selections are in alphabetical order, with ‚ÄúOther‚Äù at the end.] The instructions say to assign those list items one of several kinds of priorities.

      You might think that if you have skillfully created an online survey, all you need do is wait for the data to shower upon you so that you can start the fun: analysis, visualization, and interpretation. Hate to rain on your parade; you spend a major chunk of your project time cleaning the data before you can revel in the good stuff. No matter how carefully you design the survey, you must accept that the instrument, not to mention the lawyers, paralegals, legal-service vendors, outside counsel, and clients who take it, will confound you.

    <div class="content">
      
      Let‚Äôs turn our attention now to various places where a survey project can help respondents answer questions. Artful instructions will also make the analyst‚Äôs job easier when it comes to cleaning, standardizing, and aggregating answers. If people can willy-nilly fill in as they see fit, the analyst will have a fit (yes, a willful pun) and the quality of the information collected will degrade. We will review these instruction methods by starting with the broadest scope and proceeding to the most targetted.

    <div class="content">
      
      When your internet survey has a question that generates a string of numbers as long as the number of your respondents, such as if 100 law departments report their fees paid to outside counsel or hours committed to pro bono work, you have collected what analysts call a continuous variable. ‚ÄúContinuous‚Äù is statistician and programmer parlance for ‚Äúnumbers, with or without decimals.‚Äù The term says nothing about the order of the numbers or whether there are gaps or clusters.
