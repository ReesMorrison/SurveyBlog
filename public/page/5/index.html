      Error messages alerted by the hosting software after being triggered by a mistake or an omission on a questionnaire hark back to the jarring reminders that programmers confront. They tend to be blunt, cryptic, and annoying. You usually can&rsquo;t move on through the survey until you unravel the knot. Even worse, if the designer of the question has set validation tests, a frustrated respondent, or one who legitimately does not want to be coerced, may find it hard to create a fake answer.

      Survey sponsors crave as many qualified respondents as they can get. They resort to all manner of invitations and publicity to bump up the number. But one form of boosting, aside from taking the survey to learn from a report about a subject near and dear to the respondent, deserves special attention: offering an incentive for respondents. A handful come to mind from my consulting experience.
Sneak previews: For some invitees who are on the fence, knowing that they will receive a preliminary, quick view of the early findings might persuade them to plunge in.

      Sponsors of external surveys wish the whole world would clamor for their report and find it easily. The report is a marketing tool and the wider the dissemination the better. ‚ÄúFeel free to forward this report to your colleagues and peers!‚Äù They want to harvest emails and phone numbers from a multitude of folks who might want their services.
By contrast, reports based on surveys on compensation or proprietary information like total legal spending are intended only for the companies and firms that gave data.

      My enthusiasm for vivid graphics that convey a survey‚Äôs finding knows no bounds. If the reader‚Äôs eye immediately grasps the take-away of an attractive plot, the sponsor has done well. If, on the other hand, a plot causes confusion, delay, and page turning, that effort has come to naught.
With that ideology made clear, let‚Äôs critique the plot below, which comes from the 2023 Annual Litigation Trends Survey Report by Norton Rose Fulbright (pg.

      A negatively phrased question one year followed the next year by the inverse positively phrased would mitigate the echo-chamber effect we have discussed elsewhere. ‚ÄúWhat are the biggest obstacles in your firm to knowledge management?‚Äù followed the next year with ‚ÄúWhat are the biggest incentives in your firm for knowledge management?‚Äù The technique of what I call ‚Äúpaused inverses‚Äù in a single survey also nails down key opinions and helps spot respondents who misread or miss-applied instructions.
