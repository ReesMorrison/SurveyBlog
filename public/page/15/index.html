      if your law firm (or any of its partners) hosts a blog, then once you have published your survey report, you should publish at least one post about the findings. As an example, Morrison &amp; Foerster fielded a survey in May of 2020 about the impact of Covid19; they announced the survey on their blog with a brief description plus a link to the full report.
You will likely reach more people if you break your principal findings into a series of blog posts.

      I urge survey designers to reconsider ‚Äì ‚Äì polite talk for shun ‚Äì ‚Äì Yes/No questions because most of life scoffs at such a solar flare versus Stygian darkness view of anything; the messiness of life almost always demands more complex, nuanced answers. Sure, ‚ÄúWere you born in Texas?‚Äù admits to a binary answer, but just as surely, asking internal clients, ‚ÄúAre you pleased with the service you receive from the law department?

      Ideally, once you export to a spreadsheet the data that has been collected by your hosting software, you will read it into the scripting language of your choice and carry out every step of cleaning the data. You will remove disqualified responses, standardize titles and educational levels or other demographic questions that have an option for ‚ÄúOther,‚Äù correct incorrect answers (such as a compensation figure obviously missing a zero), and perhaps add calculated variables such as total compensation when you‚Äôve asked for base and bonus or convert foreign currencies to a standard currency.

      We continue here to discuss NLP techniques for extracting meaning from free-form text comments. The first post in the series is here while the second post is here.
Calculate Word Associations
Correlation is a statistical technique that can tell how strongly distributions of number resemble each other. For example, the correlation between the number of lawyers in a firm and the average hourly billing rate is strong; as one rises, the other tends to rise.

      The first part of this series explains typical steps that a survey analyst takes to prepare free-text comments for Natural Language Processing (NLP). In this part, we describe four methods by which a cleaned and standardized corpus lets NLP reveal insights.
Create a Word Cloud of Common Words
From the document-term matrix, software can total how many times each word appears in the corpus as a whole (all of the text questions combined text).
