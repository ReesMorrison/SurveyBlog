      Assume you have a few hundred e-mail addresses of potential participants in your survey. Rather than blast them out in one large volley, you might send them in three waves of one-third each. Assuming you have adequate time to do so, experience has shown many benefits follow from a staged emailing campaign. What I have summarized below as the steps to take at the stages all aim to create a bandwagon effect.

      When you produce a survey finding, you should want to understand that number‚Äôs reliability. If the research that produced the number were repeated several times (with everything else held constant), how much would the results vary?
Say you survey 100 general counsel and collect their total cash compensation. The median is $600,000, but you recognize that your survey produced only one sample of results from a larger population of all general counsel.

      All survey sponsors crave more participants. More participants mean more data, which signals interest in the topic and fertilizes robust analytics. But all good surveys must come to an end, so when do you decide to stop accepting new responses? For a one-shot survey, the curtain has to come down; if you plan to return to the survey next year, you will be more open to keeping the survey open. I have encountered these nine stop signs.

      Every set of survey data has values missing. This person didn‚Äôt say how many people report to them; that person didn‚Äôt fill in base compensation. Worse, missing values cause many algorithms (notably multiple regression) to drop all the data for a person if even a single number missing. So, if your survey data aims to predict your law firm&rsquo;s fees for reviewing securities law filings and you have completed 65 such matters, if 10 of them are missing total fees, you have an analyzable set of only 55 matters.

      A ‚Äúscript‚Äù is the term I will use for the programming an analyst does to turn raw survey responses into groomed output, such as tables, plots, or complete reports. Scripts have huge advantages over spreadsheet manipulations.
Reproducible: The small chunk of R code shown below reads in the Excel file that was exported from my hosting software, renames several variables (column headers in Excel) to make them more tractable, and drops a few columns that won‚Äôt be needed for the next step of the analysis.
