      Assuming you try more than one method to reach potential participants, you may want to learn which sources or methods were more successful. You would like to know absolute numbers of participants ‚Äì ‚Äúdoing X method produced 25 participants ‚Äì and proportionate numbers ‚Äì ‚ÄúZZ percent of the people sourced by phoned took part.‚Äù On the negative side, you also want to get a handle on where efforts to publicize the survey produced an insufficient number of new survey takers.

      You want as many people as possible to complete your survey. For that reason, as you decide on the first version of the questionnaire, you inevitably drop questions that would stretch the survey discouragingly long ‚Äì who will trudge through 55 questions? Or you‚Äôd love to know about the law department‚Äôs square footage, but that inquiry takes research to answer. Perhaps you admit that you can‚Äôt phrase the question or its selections in an unambiguous, answerable way.

      We have written about the advantages of modifying questions or the selections to them while a survey is still in the field. If that constitutes the only changes you make, your cleanup tasks will not be burdened. However, if you drop a question from the survey or add a question, your program code will become more convoluted.
One reason for this additional burden arises if you rename your variables to short names (doing so makes code easier to write and improves the look of axis titles on graphs, among other advantages).

      One of the methodological risks that a compensation survey particularly confronts is that respondents don‚Äôt enter correct information. It is possible, for example, that a Chief Operating Officer deliberately enters inflated values where the survey asks for salary or bonus. They may nurture a hope that if they and others put in numbers that are higher than what is true, the resulting averages and medians in the report will be too high.

      During the past six months I have been conducting a survey of law firm Chief Operating Officers, Executive Directors and equivalent roles. The outreach invited hundreds of them to take part in a quick, no-cost survey of compensation ‚Äì a price, investment of time, and topic that should attract nearly everyone. Don‚Äôt we all want to know whether we are paid ‚Äúfairly.‚Äù
But the response rate has been smallish. Why might that be?
