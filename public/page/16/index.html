      If a law firm or law department decides to pursue an online survey, the project team will need to select a software vendor. Using the software and hosting services of that vendor, a team member or consultant will create the questionnaire form that is sent, as a URL link, to invitees. In this early step of the project, the team might enlist assistance from the information technology department when they evaluate survey software.

      In the appendix to the report on your survey findings, your law firm or law department has the opportunity to say ‚Äúthank you‚Äù to those who helped and ‚Äúmy bad‚Äù for any shortcomings you recognize. Many wheels must turn in a survey project, with lots of cogs and gears; an acknowledgement, therefore, can call out a range of contributors. Based on my familiarity with many law-related surveys, I have listed below the most common items in acknowledgements.

      Every survey sponsor wants as many participants as possible to take their survey. Law firms want oodles of employees to take part or swathes of invited corporations; law departments want every internal client to weigh in or every paralegal and lawyer on the rolls. However, with survey data, quality outranks quantity, and respondents need to be both acceptable and to provide qualified answers to the online questionnaire for their answers to count.

      Put in the appendix to your report material that a few readers might want to consult, but for most readers is either irrelevant or too much to read. If it clutters the report, digresses from the major findings, or obscures the flow of the report but you don‚Äôt want to jettison it, consider adding the material to the appendix. The table of contents of the report should make clear by sub-entries what is in the appendix.

      Designers of surveys by law firms, law departments, or legal vendors use a slew of names for the capability of an online survey to jump to a question based on the answer to a previous question. The names designers give to this kind of question include ‚Äúskip logic,‚Äù ‚Äúbranching,‚Äù and ‚Äúconditional‚Äù questions; I will use the term conditional question. Conditional questions create a custom path through a survey because the answer to one question (or more than one) dictates what the next question (or a later question) asks or how it is structured.
