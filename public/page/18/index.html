      An index variable (sometimes called a ‚Äúsynthetic variable‚Äù) takes related questions on a survey and weaves their answers into a new, consolidated variable. Like the Consumer Price Index combines the prices of a range of goods and services, a survey index variable consists of the amalgamation of several questions‚Äô answers.
What good is an index variable? One benefit is consolidating the data from multiple questions that would otherwise be difficult to picture and comprehend as an overall whole.

      Law firms and law departments periodically conduct surveys of their members or clients to learn about a topic, e.g., engagement, work-from-home policies, client satisfaction, or use of AI software. Questions on the survey may invite respondents to write as much as they want for an answer. For example, ‚ÄúHow have you encountered and dealt with supply-chain obstructions?‚Äù I will call them ‚Äútext questions.‚Äù
The old-fashioned way to identify and classify ideas from free-text responses to text questions has been to read and code them by hand.

      When you create a multiple-choice question on a survey, whether it is single-choice style or check-all-that-apply, take time to sensibly order the items available for selection. This suggestion, which should be a command, applies both to radio button designs and to drop-down menus; they both list items and the arrangement of those items influences respondents. Poorly constructed items spawn all manner of pernicious, subtle distortions; here are a handful.
‚Ä¢	Inferred priority: By ‚Äúinferred priority,‚Äù I mean that some respondents might interpret the first item or two to be a deliberate elevation of them (the more socially desirable, presumed correct, or an expected choice) and demotion of later items (less desirable, wrong, or expected toward the end).

      How long it takes a typical respondent to complete your legal industry survey goes far to determine the participation rate. If an invitee glances through the survey and senses that it will be a time suck, or starts in and begins to worry that it goes on and on, they might never answer the first question or might drop out. If a lawyer or paralegal is motivated enough to click on the link he or she will probably answer at least a few questions to get a sense of how quickly they move through the questionnaire.

      No survey should be released into the wild without the thoughtful input of a person who knows in depth the domain of the survey, a **subject matter expert (SME) **. Put positively, embed as an integral contributor to your project team someone who knows deeply what they‚Äôre talking about regarding the survey topic. Mostly, SMEs surface from with the law firm, law department, or legal vendor behind the survey, but an outside resource might be retained.
