      <p>When you release an online survey to your law firm, law department, or legal service providers (outside counsel, vendors, consultants), what are the drawbacks if the responses you get back are <strong>anonymous</strong>?  By “anonymous” I mean you cannot identify which member of your firm,  department, or law-related vendor you invited to take part submitted which response.  You did not ask them for their name, their email address, their organization, or another piece of identifying information, so the response is incognito.</p>
<p>So, what’s the problem?</p>

    <div class="content">
      
      <p>Many surveys by law firms or law departments include one or more questions that must be answered.  Why?  Primarily, the sponsor believes that certain background information will play a crucial role in their analysis of the data, so they insist on respondents providing that information.  “What is your level?“ “What is your practice department?”</p>

    <div class="content">
      
      <p>Whenever your online survey has a <strong>multiple-choice question</strong>, you should include in your <strong>selections</strong> an “Other.”   Customarily, it occupies the last selection in the otherwise <strong>alphabetized selections</strong>.  Furthermore, whenever a law department, law firm or legal vendor sponsors a survey that has a question with an “Other” option, the question should be followed immediately by a <strong>text box</strong> that asks the respondent to elaborate on what they mean by “Other” (otherwise, the answer offers no information).</p>

    <div class="content">
      
      <p>When I help law firms, law departments and legal vendors conduct online surveys, they usually ask about the tempo of sending <strong>reminder emails</strong> to those invited to participate.  In other words, after the <strong>initial email</strong> introduction with the survey link that you blast out to outside counsel, all the paralegals in the firm, the R&amp;D clients above Manager, or whomever, how long do you wait to remind them that they should complete the survey?</p>

    </h2>
    
    <div class="content">
      
      <p>One of the frustrations of conducting surveys on behalf of law firms, law departments or legal vendors arises from the <strong>partial responses</strong> that are occasionally returned.  By partial response, I mean that the respondent has not answered a material number of the questions on the questionnaire or has plugged in for some questions obviously unconsidered answers, such as all “2’s” on 10 straight 1-10 evaluation questions.  In my comments below I treat the two situations the same.</p>
