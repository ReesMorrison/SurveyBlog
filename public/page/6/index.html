      A negatively phrased question one year followed the next year by the inverse positively phrased would mitigate the echo-chamber effect we have discussed elsewhere. ‚ÄúWhat are the biggest obstacles in your firm to knowledge management?‚Äù followed the next year with ‚ÄúWhat are the biggest incentives in your firm for knowledge management?‚Äù The technique of what I call ‚Äúpaused inverses‚Äù in a single survey also nails down key opinions and helps spot respondents who misread or miss-applied instructions.

      For most surveys, the questionnaire develops as the sponsor thinks of information or opinions they would like to collect. Only when the sprawl of brainstormed questions peters out does the project team step back and think about the flow of the questions in terms of their logic, priorities, time demands, and effort needed.
My vote goes to starting with easy questions, such as demographics. I am against delaying demographics, such as gender, to the end.

      Many survey sponsors ask respondents to rank a set of selections, such as to allocate 1 to 7 for seven selections. The average of each selection‚Äôs rankings becomes findings in the report, often visualized as a bar or column chart (a bubble chart offers an alternative perspective). The charts usually display the results in declining average rank order. But often whoever prepares the report fails to focus on whether the gaps between the averages are roughly equal.

      The body of a report should concentrate on succinctly explaining the survey‚Äôs findings, conclusions, and recommendations. It should not clutter the basic text with reproductions of the questionnaire elements. Often, however, on the top of a plot or table, the analyst will quote the question that produced the data shown. An excellent practice. The appendix to the report serves as the typical repository for the questionnaire.
As an exemplar, Greentarget and the Zeughauser Group lays out in the Appendix to their 2022 DEI survey not only the exact question asked but also a graphic that shows the distribution of answers.

      During the eight years that I conducted the world&rsquo;s largest benchmark survey of law departments, I proudly listed in the Appendix the names of all the participating companies. (Actually, if they requested anonymity, I did not disclose their name, but few disallowed the listing.) I believed strongly that if other companies could see who is in their industry it could persuade them to take the survey (I produced three or four surveys a year, so later in the year potential participants could examine who was already in).
