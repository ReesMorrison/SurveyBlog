      Borrowing from the saying, ‚ÄúData leads to information, which creates knowledge, and cumulates in wisdom,‚Äù we can analogize to the ladder of value and sophistication that survey reports can offer.
Response data presented in the raw, as numbers, is the most fundamental output in a survey report. You show tables or graphs that aggregate and represent the data from the survey respondents but do little more than regurgitate the numbers and explain how to read them.

      Hard as it is to reach people and persuade them to start your survey instrument, you&rsquo;re not done at that point. Respondents drop out as they move through the survey, which we will refer to as attrition.
If attrition afflicts them early, you collect only dribbles of useful information. If they submit a partial survey in which they went further, you have gained more, to be sure, but you would like them to have completed the survey.

      E-mail applications such as Gmail with Templates or Outlook with Quick Parts allow users to create a template e-mail, save it, and call it up either as a new message or as a reply to a message. Thus, if you want to thank participants individually, you can fire up the template and have most of your writing done for you once you create and revise it. You can even polish your message with an online service like Instatext [https://instatext.

      Survey sponsors should not restrict themselves to publishing a single, comprehensive, final report. Opportunities exist for them to loosen up and turn out interim aggregated reports.
If you launch a survey and keep it open in the field for months, and if during that time you keep up a drum beat of publicity and reach-out efforts, you can decide to release a first report based on the early returns. More and more respondents hear about the survey and take part.

      People who have been invited to take a survey and are debating whether to start it would prefer to know how many questions they face, how long it will likely take for them to complete the questions, what percentage are required (xref), whether they will need to do research, whether they are qualified(xref), or all these facts. I urge sponsors to cover these reasonable inquiries in the invitation email.(xref) Knowing the parameters of the survey ahead of time, a respondent who starts is more likely to keep going to the finish.
