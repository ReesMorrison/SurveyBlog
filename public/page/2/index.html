      As you carry out surveys, you begin to realize that many decisions you make cut both ways, so to speak. You gain because you take one fork, but you lose something too. I consider these bi-valent decisions to be under the rubric of trade-offs. The more aware you are of what you give up to gain something, the sharper will be your survey projects. Thought of most broadly, every survey project creates opportunity costs, a manifestation of a trade-off.

    <div class="content">
      
      Two responses from the same person happen when a survey is kept open for multiple months or when the sponsor sets in motion multiple ways of letting people know about the survey. Inevitably, people forget that they have completed the survey (ouch, not a memorable survey!). It is important to cull duplicate submissions because they will distort findings, especially if you subset your data into relatively small groups.
You can cut down on the number of duplicate responses by barring more than one response from the same ISP address.

      Most survey experts look down on range questions, those that ask for a selection from a list of ranges. ‚ÄúWas your total income last year: Less than $50,000; Between $50,000 and $100,000; $100,000 to $150,000‚Äù etc. Far better to ask for specific numbers, even if they are approximations, so that you can work with the resulting figures. You can do statistical analysis, for example, and your graphics can flourish immensely more detail.

    </h2>
    
    <div class="content">
      
      The raison d‚Äôetre of a serial survey is for the sponsor to discover and proclaim changes in meaningful metrics over time. Based on the responses to their survey a year ago and the one this year, they want to shout from the rooftops that ‚ÄúTotal legal spending as a percentage of revenue in the telecom industry climbed from 0.66 to 0.75 during the past year!‚Äù Setting aside quibbles about margin of error, to evaluate the legitimacy of such claims, readers should focus on the degree of similarity of the respondents last year to this year.

    <div class="content">
      
      At the start of your questionnaire, just below the title, the first text the respondent sees should be an introduction. It should explain for the newly arrived respondent both the purpose of the survey and the road map ahead. Remember, not everyone who reaches the online link for the survey will have gotten the invitation email that explains this background information. Someone might have forwarded the link to a group or a person without much context or detail.
