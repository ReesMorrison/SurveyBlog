      In the fourth quarter of 2022, the law firm Katten Muchin Rosenman wanted to survey middle-market private equity investors. To help the firm do so, it engaged a ‚Äúleading global third-party panel provider platform.‚Äù The brief methodology section in the report does not disclose the name of the panel provider or how it found 100 U.S. based respondents. Meanwhile, what is a panel provider (aka research panel) and what do they offer survey sponsors?

      An omnipresent piece of the publicity puzzle is the press release. To let the world know about your survey or the report based on one, firms and vendors in the legal market issue press releases. They send them to a selection of news outlets that might want to write about their undertaking or findings. Reporters call about the release, ask questions and, hopefully, an editor approves their article for publication.

      I have collected here various items that will eventually be integrated into larger discussions. I have labeled each one with an appropriate key survey term.
Conditional logic: Rather than the hosting software serving a question based on an earlier answer &ndash; a conditional logic question, here is an example of doing it by hand, so to speak, from the State Bar of Michigan 2023 Economics of Law Survey. This old-fashioned method doesn&rsquo;t shorten the survey and could lead to a respondent answering it by mistake.

      No law firm, department, or vendor leaks its internal survey to the outside world. Of course not. But here the focus instead is on external surveys. Most sponsors take pains to prepare a handsome PDF report. Then they allow ‚Äì actively encourage, in fact &ndash; anyone to download it from their website, often after the downloader provides contact information. Additionally, sponsors e-mail the report to all their survey‚Äôs respondents. But those paths are not the only ones; here are seven other ways to release a survey‚Äôs findings to the public.

      For sponsors, reaching prospective clients motivates and dominates their thinking about whether to roll out a survey. Survey reports promote the expertise of the sponsor and raise awareness of it among potential buyers. Burnishing a firm&rsquo;s brand, a survey showcases the knowledge possessed by the partners or executives, their relationships with prospects and clients, and what they know about legal issues. Combining those resources with proprietary data, previously unseen findings, and graphical capabilities, a survey‚Äôs published report makes tangible the smarts of the sponsor.
