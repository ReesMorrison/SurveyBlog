  <h1>Issue a Press Release about the Survey and Report</h1>
  
  
  <article class="content">
    
    <p>An omnipresent piece of the publicity puzzle is the <strong>press release</strong>.  To let the world know about your survey or the report based on one, firms and vendors in the legal market issue press releases.  They send them to a selection of news outlets that might want to write about their undertaking or findings.  Reporters call about the release, ask questions and, hopefully, an editor approves their article for publication.</p>
<p>Like a teaser but with some meat, a release is a slider rather than a quarter pounder.  The goal is to attract attention and prompt readers of the articles written about the release to download the report (and incidentally leave their all-important contact details).</p>
<p>Successful press releases are works of art although at the same time they exhibit a formulaic structure and style.  Much has been written about crafting an effective release, one that garners media attention.  Therefore, here I will note a few points from my own experience and from the website of <a href="https://mailchimp.com/resources/writing-press-releases/">MailChimp</a>.</p>
<p>In an ideal world, you would craft your release for a specific journalist or outlet. ‚ÄúLet them know if you‚Äôre interested in being featured in coverage about a wider industry trend, a feature article, or as an expert with a timely opinion.‚Äù Be sure to indicate that you know whom you‚Äôre writing to and why your survey activity is a fit for coverage in their publication.</p>
<p>Like a newspaper article, cluster the key facts in the first paragraph or two.  Content information like in the <strong>introductory text</strong> serves well: numbers and types of respondents, how long the series has been running, increases in participation from the previous survey, and other goodies.</p>
<p>Quotes are stylized: ‚ÄúSenior executive/partner ABC is proud to blah blah.‚Äù  Positive spin whirls everywhere!</p>
<p>Most people won‚Äôt open attachments from strangers, so limit your press release to a length and format that can be sent in the body of an email.   Link to a blog site or your own website for more elaborate background.</p>
<p>Survey sponsors can also turn to services that will distribute the press release more broadly.  Several press release agencies are listed <a href="https://www.g2.com/categories/press-release-distribution">here</a>.</p>
<p>One related technique, we suggest, is pre-publication distribution of the report to a favored reporter.  They will honor the embargo (blackout) because they get a head start on competitors and can scoop the others with their early piece.</p>
